      <h3>
       How We Got Started
      </h3>
      <p>
       furfly.net is truly a small business.  We started out in April,
       1999 with two people and seven cats (the name begins to make 
       more sense now, eh?). We (that is, Mike and Janine) wanted to 
       start our own business and run it by our rules, where customer 
       service and satisfaction are just as important, if not more 
       important, than the bottom line.
      </p>
      <p>
       After working for established companies for years, we finally 
       decided that 1999 was the year for us to go out on our own; we 
       knew we could do a great job at this if we could make our own
       decisions. So we set up an office in our home, tried to teach the
       cats to step over the keyboards, not on them, and opened for
       business. 
      </p>
      <p>
       In May, 1999 we started getting busy, and realized we were going
       to need some help.  We now have several more people working with 
       us, and we'll continue to add more as the need arises.  You can
       watch us grow on our <a href="people.html">People</a> page.
      </p>
      <a name="philosophy"></a>
      <h3>
       Our Philosophy
      </h3>
      <p>
       We started this business because we wanted to offer excellent
       customer service, and that is our primary philosophy: treat the
       customer well and he/she will be happy, and will speak well of us
       to others. Sounds obvious, but too many companies just don't seem
       to get it!
      </p>
      <p>
       We make these promises to our customers:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
         We will only sign a customer if we truly feel we can do our best
         work for him/her.
       </li>
       <li>
         We will work with our customers to define exactly what they want
         us to create for them - look, feel, content, purpose, etc. We
         will design the web site you want, not the web site we think you
         should have (although we will provide as much design input as you
         would like from us).
       </li>
       <li>
         We will set realistic deadlines, and will do our absolute best to
         meet them. If we can't meet a deadline we'll alert the customer
         to the delay as soon as we become aware of it, and will give a
         new deadline right away.
       </li>
       <li>
         We will respond to customer contact (e-mail, phone calls, etc) in
         a timely manner.
       </li>
       <li>
         We will maintain excellent communication with our customers in
         every way, including individual project status and information on
         system or software problems if they occur. If a problem occurs
         which was our fault, we will go out of our way to disclose that
         fact; we truly believe that honesty is the best policy.
       </li>
       <li>
         If a customer asks us to do something we don't know how to do,
         we will tell them so, and give an honest opinion on whether
         it's something we can learn to do well.  If it's not, we will
         provide as much assistance as necessary to find someone who
         can do it, and will work with that person to ensure that the
         task is done to the customer's satisfaction.
      </ul>
      <a name="tech"></a>
      <h3>
       Our Technology
      </h3>
      <p>
       We use <a href="http://www.intel.com" target="new">Intel</a>
       servers running <a href="http://www.redhat.com" target="new">Red
       Hat</a> <a href="http://www.linux.org" target="new">Linux</a>; we keep our
       systems at <a href="http://www.exodus.net" target="new">Exodus</a>
       (<em>the</em> place for clean power and great network
       connectivity). Janine uses an identical Linux system for her 
       development work, and Mike uses an <a href="http://www.apple.com" 
       target="new">Apple Macintosh</a> for graphics and design work and 
       Linux for systems maintenance and such. Our database is <a 
       href="http://www.oracle.com" target="new"> Oracle</a>, our web 
       server is <a href="http://www.aolserver.com" target="new">AOLServer
       </a>, and we use the <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com" 
       target="new">ArsDigita</a> toolkit, which is full of nifty things 
       ranging from scripts for monitoring the health of the web servers 
       to a full e-commerce package.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are very nearly a <a href="http://www.webho.com/WealthClock"
       target="new">Microsoft</a>-Free Zone; we do have several systems
       running <a href="http://www.fourmilab.to/documents/top10.html"
       target="new">Windows</a> only because there are things you just
       can't get any other way. Plus, the vast majority of people out
       there are on Windows so we can't just pretend it doesn't exist.
       But whenever possible we choose a UNIX or <a href= 
       "http://www.apple.com" target="new">Apple</a> solution.
      </p>

      <h3>
       Our Mission Statement
      </h3>
      <p>
       Most companies these days seem to have a mission statement, a nice
       catchy phrase they can use to start out their PowerPoint
       presentations to venture capitalists. Well, we don't use PowerPoint
       and we're not looking for any venture capital, but we have a mission
       statement anyway:
      </p>
<p>
      <em>
       "Create websites with artistry and purpose, and try to have enough
       time left over to have a life, too".
      </em>
</p>
      <p>
       We're still working on that last part...
      </p>
