       Here's a list of the technical skills we have at our disposal. If you
       need something that's not listed, most likely we can do it; this just
       lists things we've done before:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        HTML page design and development.
       </li>
       <li>
        Custom graphics created from drawings, clip art, photos, or any
        non-copyrighted source.
       </li>
       <li>
        Complete photography service. We can take photos of your products, or
        create images to illustrate your site. We can work in small, medium
        or large formats, studio or on location, film or digital.
       </li>
       <li>
        Custom programming done in Tcl, Perl, JavaScript, Java or C++,
        depending on what's most appropriate for the task.
       </li>
       <li>
        Customized e-commerce, with or without Cybercash.
       </li>
       <li>
        Site promotion, including submission to numerous search engines.
       </li>
       <li>
        System hardware spec'd, purchased, assembled and installed.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There are a number of site features we have pre-programmed, which can
       be added to your site with little or no custom programming required:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The Excite search engine, which allows the user to do a full text
        search of your site.
       </li>
       <li>
        A very flexible form handling program, which in most cases will allow
        you to set up and maintain forms to collect data from your users
        yourself (if you want to, that is).
       </li>
       <li>
        Bulletin board software which will allow your site to have discussion
        areas (with or without moderation, all posts archvied to a database).
       </li>
       <li>
        Classified Ad board, a specialized version of the bulletin board.
       </li>
       <li>
        Calendar software, allowing users to enter events they wish to be
        reminded of.
       </li>
       <li>
        A comment and related link feature where users can be invited to add
        comments and links to certain pages on your site where you feel that
        user feedback is appropriate.
       </li>
       <li>
        Clickthrough tracking and ad server for banner ads.
       </li>
       <li>
        Contest software, allowing you to run a contest on your site.
       </li>
       <li>
        A trouble ticket tracker, to allow users to report problems and track
        their resolution (best for technical support sites and intranets).
       </li>
       <li>
        A mailing list manager, for sending out newsletters and other group
        messages.
       </li>
       <li>
        Postcard software, allowing the user to send their friends a postcard
        with your image(s) on it.
       </li>
       <li>
        Locator software, useful for retailers and others with multiple
        locations to assist a user in finding their nearest match.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Many of the above programs make use of a database (we use Oracle) to
       store necessary information. We can also do custom programming for you
       to store, retrieve, process and display your data on your site.
