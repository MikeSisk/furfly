       <a href="mailto:janine@furfly.net">Janine Sisk</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Janine received a BS degree in Computer Science from the University of
       California, Irvine (UCI) and has been working in the computer industry
       since 1985. She started out doing software testing, worked as a UNIX
       system administrator for five years, and spent five years at Autodesk
       working in configuration management and engineering. She has been
       doing software development for the last five years.

       <a href="mailto:mike@furfly.net">Mike Sisk</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Mike studied geology at the University of Kansas, and spent several
       years working out in the field before he gave it up to sit in a nice
       clean air-conditioned office and work with computers. He worked for
       Autodesk for eight years, starting out in product support, passing
       through configuration management and ending up in software testing.

      <h3>
       <a href="mailto:don@furfly.net">Don Baccus</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Don has a BS in Math from Oregon State University. He has been a
       software developer since he was in high school, in the early 70s. He
       wrote a wide variety of programs in the old days, some of which are
       now in a software museum! He co-founded Oregon Software in 1977, where
       he designed and developed compiler software as computers evolved
       through the 80s. In 1988 he left to become a consultant; he has been
       working for Rational Corporation for the last six years.

       Web Experience
      </h3>
      <p>
       All of us have been on the Net since the mid '80s, when there was only
       e-mail and Usenet. We've used a number of different online services
       and have participated in the growth and development of the Internet
       since it's beginning. Our background in software development and
       testing, including user interface design and evaluation, sets us apart
       from most web developers. We know what it takes to do a major software
       project from start to finish, and the same principles can be
       successfully applied to web site projects as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until recently, Mike and Janine worked for a web development company
       in Southern California, where we underwent a sort of "web boot camp".
       The two of us were the only software folks on the staff, and were
       responsible for all system administration and backend software tasks,
       including being webmaster and bugmaster. We learned a tremendous
       amount about what it takes to do this business right. We bring that
       trial by fire experience to this company, and we believe that we are
       much stronger for it. We are also already accustomed to working long
       hours, something which is often required in this business!
