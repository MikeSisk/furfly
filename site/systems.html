      <h3>
       System Administration Tasks
      </h3>
      <p>
       We do nightly backups to disk, for easy restores, and weekly backups
       to tape. We keep at least two month's worth of backup tapes available
       for restoration if necessary, more if requested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our systems are monitored in two ways: Exodus monitors our live
       server, and a service called Uptime, running at MIT in Cambridge, MA
       monitors all our systems. We will be notified via our Surepage pager
       if either service detects a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our web server (AOLserver) and our database (Oracle) are monitored by
       a suite of monitoring tools from ArsDigita. These tools are able to
       recognize some error conditions and automatically correct them, and
       will notify us via pager if an error occurs that they are not able to
       correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       We run a link-verification suite an all sites we host on a monthly
       basis, to check for broken links. This is most important to sites
       which contain links to external sites, which may have moved or been
       taken down since the link was last checked.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Support Software
      </h3>
      <p>
       We provide two stats packages: Analog and NetTracker 4.0. Analog is a
       freeware product which does basic site statistics; it's very fast and
       accurate and provides most of the information most web site owners are
       interested in, but one thing it does not provide is a visitor count.
       NetTracker is on the opposite end of the spectrum - it's not overly
       fast, but it's very sophisticated, highly configurable, and provides
       all the information you could ever want (and then some). All our
       customers have Analog stats available to them; Nettracker is an
       extra-cost option.
      </p>
      <p>
       We use AddWeb to do search engine submissions; we generally recommend
       that sites be submitted once a quarter or when the site has changed
       substantially. Most search engines specify a minimum time between
       submissions on the same site, and AddWeb observes this automatically.
      </p>
      <h3>
       The Future
      </h3>
      <p>
       We're currently building a high-availability, high-performance server
       cluster to provide a virtually 100% uptime web service (as close as
       you can get, anyway). Not that we have a lot of downtime now; so far
       we've had 100% uptime with our current systems, and it's hard to
       improve on that. But a server cluster provides a lot more redundancy;
       an entire system can fail and the web sites will stay up. That's a
       Good Thing!
