       <a href="people.html">People</a>: Our Board of Directors
      </h2>
      <p>
       <em>Starbuck</em> (Bucky) is our CEF - Chief Executive Feline. His job
       is supervising everything that happens in our office, and making sure
       everyone knows that He Is In Charge. Bucky is a Tonkinese.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>Samantha</em> (Sammie) is our Lap Inspector. She knows that a
       person sitting at a computer isn't likely to be getting up for a
       while, and that that's a good time for a lap test. Sammie is a Birman.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>Camille</em> (Cammie) helps us practice our customer service
       skills - she's very skittish and can be difficult to approach, even
       when she clearly wants attention. We have learned a lot about gentle
       persistence while trying to earn Cammie's trust. Cammie is also a
       Birman; she and Sammie are sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>Chloe</em> is our special needs kitty - she doesn't see very well,
       and spends most of each day tunneled under the covers on our bed. She
       comes out in the evening and can be very affectionate, but her daily
       hibernation means she doesn't contribute much to the company. We
       consider her to be on permanent disability status. Chloe is a mixed
       breed, probably half-tabby and half-Abyssinian, or perhaps Bengal.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>Zoe</em> is our security guard. She doesn't like anything new, and
       lets us know when things are unfamiliar by growling. This includes new
       people anywhere outside the house, and, unfortunately, new kitties
       inside the house. Zoe is also a mixed breed; she and Chloe are
       sisters, but Zoe is most likely all tabby.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>Rebecca</em> (Becky) is our youngest employee. She is still
       learning the ropes, but manages to keep very busy carrying off binder
       clips, rearranging papers and harassing other cats. Becky is a
       Tonkinese.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>Wilma Flintstone</em> (Wilma) is our newest employee in the
       Irvine office. She is also young, but makes up for it with her 
       tenacity and exuberance. Feather toys don't stand a chance with 
       Wilma! She and Becky hang out together, and they alternate 
       between playing hard and napping hard. The naps often take place 
       on top of our monitors. Wilma is also a Tonkinese (yes, we've 
       become quite partial to Tonks!).
      </p>
      <p>
       Last, but definitely not least, we have to mention Rascal. She passed
       away in March, but for nearly 14 years she ruled every house she lived
       in, with Janine in attendance. She was The Queen, She Who Must Be
       Obeyed among cats. Her passing was very sudden and we miss her very
       much; we plan to have a memorial page for her. She was very much a mixed
       breed; we think there may have been some Siamese in there (definitely
       a talker) and probably some Maine Coon (we're talkin' <em>serious</em>
       fur!).
